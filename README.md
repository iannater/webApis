# Ian's Quiz

This homework was really challenging as expected. I am pretty proud of the HTML and CSS that I did. I was able to get that part completed no problem and I think it looks similar to the demo. 

On the Javascript- I was able to get it started but after a tutor session I got pretty confused about how to display the answers and know which one was right. I was working off a way that I saw online but the tutor said there was a better way using object with arrays but it kinda threw me off. Had a hard time getting it to work once we made those changes to the arrays and functions. Unfortunately I am traveling this week and was unable to complete it.
